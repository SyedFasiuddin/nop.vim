nop.vim: Use better vim movement
================================

Why does this plugin exists?\
Watch [this](https://youtu.be/OnUiHLYZgaA?t=261) video to know.\
This plugin is intended to let users focus on better movement operators that are
in vim, by not allowing them to use anti-pattern keys. By disabling backspace
and `hjkl` keys, this plugin makes sure that one can learn better ways of doing
stuff that they want to do.

[hardmode](https://github.com/wikitopian/hardmode) already exists then why
this repo?\
The only reason being, I was constantly thinking of turning off hardmode, when I
had the option to do so.\
This repo doesn't try to do that, it just turns off
keys that lead to anti-pattern.

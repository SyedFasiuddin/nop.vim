nop.vim: Use better vim movement
================================

Why does this plugin exists?\
Watch [this](https://youtu.be/OnUiHLYZgaA?t=261) video to know.

[hardmode](https://github.com/wikitopian/hardmode) already exists then why
this repo?\
The only reason being, I was constantly thinking of turning off hardmode, when I
had the option to do so.\
This repo doesn't try to do that, it just turns off
keys that lead to anti-pattern.
